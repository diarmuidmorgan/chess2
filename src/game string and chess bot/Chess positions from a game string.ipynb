    "## Getting features out of a game string\n",
    "I don't think this can be called feature 'extraction', in a proper sense, as there is a clear defined, domain specific way in which to extract features from our domain data. We probably should have used a library to do this, but we had extra time on our hands, and we had always kind of wanted to produce something that could play chess by ourselves. It is, I think, one of the standard programming projects that people undertake as a way of getting better at code. In addition, a chess library/engine, would have also already included a function for evaluating a board position/predicting a winner. So in a way, it either made sense to build everything from the ground up or not at all!\n",

However, to understand this, the computer needs to know the movement patterns of both knights, the movement pattern of the bishop, and it needs an idea of the rules describing what is and what isn't legal.\n",

It seemed a shame to not go the last step, and implement the full 'chess engine', even if it is very slow! Our code is so unefficient though, that we can only reasonably look two moves ahead. In addition, we found our model to be weakest in the early 'opening' stage of the game, so we mapped the first 20 positions of each game in our dataset to a kind of tree in a JSON file, and we have the bot play through those until the game diverges from what is stored in the tree.\n",

There is a particularly pernicious bug where the chess bot will think it can castle twice, and effectively double its number of kings. Over all, it plays chess rather badly. It will sometimes exhibit a good run of play, and then make a move so desperately bad that we will feel embarrased for it.\n",

E.g, a 70% accuracy score is not very good at all, when one poorly evaluated move can completely wreck a game of chess. A 90% accuracy score is not particularly good, when, with some models, a decision based on the model can wreck peoples' lives. In addition, the bot considers moves that a human would never play, and sometimes scores them quite well, which might say something about 'overfitting' in regard to our random forest model."
