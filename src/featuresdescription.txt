 ** basicScore - the sum of all material on the board, where black pieces have negative value

** canCastle - the sum of white and blacks castling rights (negative for black)
Tracks if a player has the right to castle kingside/queenside. Not if they can immdeiately castle.
If both black has the right to castle on both king/queen side, it's score will be -2. If white also has both castling rights, it's score will be 2, and the resulting score will be 0.

** captures. Should track the sum of all material that can be captured in a board position. E.g if white can take a queen with both a rook and a pawn (-9+-9) and black can capture a pawn with a knight and a bishop with a rook (1+3), this score would be -14.

** centrePawns. Should sum the total pawns on the four centre squares (negative for black).

** checked. Negative 1 if black is in check. Positive one if white is in check.

** enpassants. +1 if white has an enpassant opporunity. Negative one if black has such an opportunity. Should never be outside range (-1, 1)

**fianachettos (should read fianchettos) Tracks the number of bishops in fianchetto squares. Read up on it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fianchetto

**forks tracks the sum of forked material. E.g if a white queen can choose between capturing either a rook or a knight, this features value will be (-5+-3).

**hasCastled Tracks if either side has castled. +1 if only white has castled. 0 if both side have castled/haven't castled

**kingMoves Tracks the amount of legal moves available to the king. Could be important in the end game. Not so much in the opening, where it would be best if the king has only one legal move.

**move Tracks the number of moves since the game began

**moves Tracks the sum total of moves available to each player. 0, if both players have the same amount of valid moves.

**pawnLines Tracks the number of pawns that have a pawn of their color on the right/left diagonals in front of them.

**stackedPawns Tracks the number of pawns that have a pawn of their own color directly in front of them

**pawnRanks Tracks the sum of colored pawns progression from their back rank. E.g, before the game has begun, this should be 0. If white plays e4, this should increase to two.

**pawnsGuardingKings Tracks the sum of pawns guarding the king e.g adjacent to it and in front of it on it's left diagonal, right diagonal, and directly in front of it.

**pins Sums the number of pieces on the board that are pinned at anyone time. Negative if more of blacks pieces are pinned than whites... best_score

**protects Tracks the sum of material that is protected at any one time - e.g has a piece that can recapture, if the original piece is taken. There is scope here for also counting the value of the material that is 'doing the protecting', and I think this should be added as a feature
